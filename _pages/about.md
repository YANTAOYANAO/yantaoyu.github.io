I am an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and the director of the [Human-Centered Intelligent Construction Lab (HCIC)](https://ceyantao.people.ust.hk/). I obtained both my bachelors' and master's degeree from Tsinghua Univeristy. Then I received my Ph.D. in Construction Informatics at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. 

## Research insterest
My research interests revolve around the advancement and enhancement of information technologies and robotics within the construction field:
- Construction robotics: SLAM on construction sites, worker-robot collaboration;
- Construction safety: ergonomic assessment, fatigue assessment;
- Digital Twin and BIM for ageing bulidings and infrastructures.

## <span style="color: #6495ED;"> Looking for new team members</span>
I am looking for responsible and motivated Ph.D. students/research assistants/postdocs with backgrounds in Civil Engineering, Construction Management, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Biomechanics, Industial Engineering or other fields. 
If you are interested, please email me (ceyantao@ust.hk) with your CV. 
For undergraduate students, remote internships and summer internships are available.
